# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the complete end-to-end workflow execution of the multi-agent automation platform. Users will be able to configure, run, and monitor agent workflows that follow the Work → Process → Publish → Validate pattern. The system will provide interfaces through both a web application and Chrome extension to interact with and visualize the workflow execution and results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local Development Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the entire platform locally with all services (backend, frontend, database, cache) so that I can develop and test the complete system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs the setup command THEN the system SHALL start PostgreSQL, Redis, backend API, and frontend web server
2. WHEN all services are running THEN the system SHALL be accessible at defined ports (frontend: 3000, backend: 3001, PostgreSQL: 5432, Redis: 6379)
3. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the database schema and create necessary tables
4. WHEN services fail to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which service failed and why
5. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide a helpful message listing required variables

### Requirement 2: Agent Workflow Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure a workflow by selecting and connecting different agents (Work → Process → Publish → Validate) so that I can create automated data pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the workflow configuration page THEN the system SHALL display available agents grouped by category (Work, Process, Publish, Validate)
2. WHEN the user selects an agent THEN the system SHALL display its configuration options and required parameters
3. WHEN the user connects agents THEN the system SHALL validate that the output of one agent is compatible with the input of the next
4. WHEN the user saves a workflow THEN the system SHALL persist the workflow configuration to the database
5. IF the workflow configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display validation errors with specific details
6. WHEN the user creates a workflow THEN the system SHALL support the pattern: Work Agent → Process Agent → Publish Agent → Validate Agent

### Requirement 3: Agent Registration and Discovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically register available agents so that users can discover and use them in workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL register all built-in agent types (WebScraper, TextProcessor, TwitterPublish, PerformanceMonitor, etc.)
2. WHEN an agent is registered THEN the system SHALL store its metadata (name, category, version, capabilities, configuration schema)
3. WHEN the user requests available agents THEN the system SHALL return a list of registered agents with their metadata
4. WHEN the user filters agents by category THEN the system SHALL return only agents matching that category
5. IF an agent fails to register THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue registering other agents

### Requirement 4: Workflow Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want to execute a configured workflow so that the agents perform their tasks in sequence and produce results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user triggers workflow execution THEN the system SHALL execute agents in the configured order (Work → Process → Publish → Validate)
2. WHEN an agent executes THEN the system SHALL pass the output of the previous agent as input to the current agent
3. WHEN an agent completes THEN the system SHALL emit events indicating execution status (started, progress, completed, failed)
4. WHEN an agent fails THEN the system SHALL stop the workflow and record the error details
5. IF the workflow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL store the final results and execution metrics
6. WHEN a workflow is executing THEN the system SHALL enforce resource limits (memory, CPU, timeout) for each agent

### Requirement 5: Real-time Workflow Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor workflow execution in real-time so that I can see progress and identify issues immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is executing THEN the system SHALL display real-time status updates for each agent
2. WHEN an agent emits progress events THEN the system SHALL update the UI to show current progress percentage
3. WHEN an agent completes THEN the system SHALL display execution time and resource usage
4. WHEN an agent fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and stack traces
5. IF the user navigates away THEN the system SHALL continue execution and allow the user to return to view status

### Requirement 6: Web Application Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the platform through a web application so that I can configure workflows, view results, and manage agents from my browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the web application THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with workflow list and execution history
2. WHEN the user creates a new workflow THEN the system SHALL provide a visual workflow builder interface
3. WHEN the user views workflow results THEN the system SHALL display collected data, processed content, publish status, and validation reports
4. WHEN the user views execution history THEN the system SHALL display past executions with timestamps, status, and metrics
5. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page (Web3 wallet connection)

### Requirement 7: Chrome Extension Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access workflow information through a Chrome extension so that I can quickly view agent status and results without opening the full web application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the Chrome extension THEN the system SHALL display a summary of active workflows and their status
2. WHEN the user clicks on a workflow THEN the system SHALL display detailed execution information in a popup
3. WHEN a workflow completes THEN the system SHALL show a browser notification with the result summary
4. WHEN the user triggers a workflow from the extension THEN the system SHALL start execution and show real-time progress
5. IF the backend is unreachable THEN the system SHALL display an offline indicator and cached data

### Requirement 8: Data Flow Validation

**User Story:** As a system, I want to validate data compatibility between connected agents so that workflows execute without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are connected in a workflow THEN the system SHALL validate that output types match input types
2. WHEN a Work Agent outputs data THEN the system SHALL ensure it conforms to the CollectedData schema
3. WHEN a Process Agent receives input THEN the system SHALL validate it matches the ProcessAgentInput schema
4. WHEN a Publish Agent receives content THEN the system SHALL validate it matches the PublishContent schema
5. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating the mismatch

### Requirement 9: Example Workflow Implementation

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to see and run example workflows so that I can understand how to use the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the platform for the first time THEN the system SHALL provide pre-configured example workflows
2. WHEN the user runs an example workflow THEN the system SHALL execute: WebScraper → TextProcessor → TwitterPublish → PerformanceMonitor
3. WHEN the example workflow completes THEN the system SHALL display all intermediate results and final validation report
4. WHEN the user views example configuration THEN the system SHALL show commented explanations of each setting
5. IF the user modifies an example THEN the system SHALL save it as a new workflow without affecting the original

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent throws an error THEN the system SHALL capture the error with full context (agent ID, input data, stack trace)
2. WHEN a workflow fails THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry from the failed agent or restart from the beginning
3. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL retry the operation with exponential backoff
4. WHEN resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL terminate the agent gracefully and log resource usage
5. IF the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue operations and retry when the connection is restored

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent executes THEN the system SHALL log execution start time, end time, duration, and resource usage
2. WHEN a workflow completes THEN the system SHALL calculate and store aggregate metrics (total time, total cost, success rate)
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with severity level, timestamp, and context
4. WHEN the user views logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by time range, agent type, and severity level
5. IF debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL log detailed information including input/output data for each agent

### Requirement 12: API Endpoints for Workflow Management
