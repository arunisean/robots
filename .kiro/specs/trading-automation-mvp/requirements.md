# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for transforming the Multi-Agent Automation Platform into a **Web3 Trading Automation Platform**. The platform will enable users to automate cryptocurrency trading strategies using pre-configured strategy templates with minimal technical knowledge. The focus shifts from content automation to financial trading automation, with agent categories redesigned to support trading workflows: Monitor → Analyze → Execute → Verify.

The MVP (Phase 1) prioritizes user experience through "one-click" strategy templates, allowing users to start automated trading within minutes while maintaining strong risk controls and transparency.

## Glossary
