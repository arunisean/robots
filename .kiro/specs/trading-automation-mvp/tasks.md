## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional testing tasks that can be skipped for faster MVP delivery
- Core implementation tasks (1-16) must be completed for a functional MVP
- Strategy templates (10-12) can be implemented incrementally - start with Grid Trading
- Exchange integrations (8-9) should be completed before strategy templates that depend on them
- Frontend UI (14-15) can be developed in parallel with backend implementation
- All tasks reference specific requirements from requirements.md for traceability
