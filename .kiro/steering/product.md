# Product Overview

## Web3 Trading Automation Platform (Web3交易自动化平台)

A decentralized trading automation system with Web3 identity authentication that enables users to automate cryptocurrency trading strategies using pre-configured templates with minimal technical knowledge.

## Core Concept

A custom-built workflow orchestration system specifically designed for AI-powered trading automation. The platform enables users to deploy and manage automated trading strategies using four types of specialized agents implemented with an abstract base class pattern:

- **Monitor Agents**: Market data collection (CEX/DEX prices, on-chain data, gas prices, wallet tracking)
- **Analyze Agents**: Trading signal generation (technical analysis, arbitrage detection, risk assessment)
- **Execute Agents**: Trade execution (CEX orders, DEX swaps, DeFi operations)
- **Verify Agents**: Execution validation and risk monitoring (P&L calculation, performance tracking)

## Key Features

- **Web3 Authentication**: ETH wallet login (MetaMask support)
- **Strategy Templates**: Pre-configured trading strategies (Grid Trading, Arbitrage, Whale Tracking)
- **One-Click Launch**: Start automated trading within minutes with minimal configuration
- **Paper Trading**: Test strategies with simulated funds before risking real capital
- **Risk Controls**: Automated safety mechanisms (max loss limits, position size limits, daily loss caps)
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live dashboard with P&L tracking, trade history, and performance metrics
- **Multi-Exchange Support**: CEX (Binance, OKX) and DEX (Uniswap, PancakeSwap) integration
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Automated execution pipeline
  - Sequential agent execution (Monitor → Analyze → Execute → Verify)
  - Parallel data collection from multiple sources
  - Conditional execution based on trading signals
  - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- **Strategy Marketplace** (Future): Discover, purchase, and rent community-created strategies as NFTs
